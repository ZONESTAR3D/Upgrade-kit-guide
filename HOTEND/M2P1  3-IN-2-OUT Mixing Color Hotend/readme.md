1. Open the directory where you installed the Cura software, such as "C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7"
2. copy the files in "resources" to "C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7\resources" 
3. copy the files in "plugins" to "C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7\plugins" 


If you use other operating systems, the operation is almost the same
