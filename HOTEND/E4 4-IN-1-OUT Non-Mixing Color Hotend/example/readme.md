## :warning: ATTETION PLEASE :warning: 
### 1. Refer to the below pictures to load filaments every time you print by E4 hotend. To check whether the filaments are loaded to the initial position.

#### :pushpin: If the last printing has been successfully completed, usually you can skip this step.
### 2. Before you leave the machine, please wait and confirm that the "preload line" has been printed.

#### :pushpin: These lines may not enough complete because filament preloading positions is different, don't worry about this. However, you have to ensure that each filament can be normally loaded into the hot end and flow out from the nozzle.
