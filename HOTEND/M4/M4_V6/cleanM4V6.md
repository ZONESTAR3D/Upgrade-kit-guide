### [:clapper:Video tutorial](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Z8P/assets/29502731/72312727-5ce5-4a35-8f2a-49f9145557ac).
### Operation steps
#### Step 1: Heating the nozzle to 260 degree. 
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>Preheat nozzle: 260***, wait the nozzle reached 260 degree.
#### Step 2: Load all 4 filaments to the hot end (Watch the PTFE tubes in hot end and ensure the filaments has already entered the hot end).
#### Step 3: Extruder all filaments simultaneously, until you can see the filament is flowed out from the nozzle.
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: all***
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>slowly load***, you may need to do a few times, until all 4 filaments have flowed out from the nozzle.
#### Step 4: Extrude 4 filaments one by one
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: 1***
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: slowly load***, until you see the filament of extruder #1 is flowing out from the nozzle.
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: 2***
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: slowly load***, until you see the filament of extruder #2 is flowing out from the nozzle.
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: 3***
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: slowly load***, until you see the filament of extruder #3 is flowing out from the nozzle.
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: 4***
- ***Prepare>>Filament>>extruder: slowly load***, until you see the filament of extruder #3 is flowing out from the nozzle.

#### If the hot end cannot be cleaned by doing the above steps, or the hot end is still easily clogged after cleaning, you need to replace the nozzle or replace the "inner PTFE tubes"ï¼Œ please refer to [this guide](./ReplaceM4V6InnerPTFE.md).
