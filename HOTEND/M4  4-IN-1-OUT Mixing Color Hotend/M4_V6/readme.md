## :book: M4V6 hot end use manual
ZONESTAR 4-IN-1-OUT **mix color** hot end (referred to as **M4 Hot end**) has 4 input channels and 1 nozzle, four filaments are mixed in the hot end and then extruded through a nozzle.Therefore, the M4 hot end not only allows the printer to print the original color of the filaments, but also allows for printing more colors by adjusting the filament mixing ratio.

### 6.Installation & wiring
The mounting position of M4 hot end conform to the "ZONESTAR hot end mounting standard", which can be installed on almost all ZONESTAR 3d printers, including P802, M8, D805S, Z8, Z9, Z10 etc. series of products.   
#### 6.1 Installation
Simply remove the 3 screws behind the hot end assembly and install the M4 hotend assembly on the X carrier of the machine.
![](./M4_installation.jpg)  
#### 6.2 Wiring
##### :loudspeaker: **Attention** 
- **Please watch for to distinguish terminals 3 and 4**, because their terminals  color are the same, but the wires color are different.    
If the wires of 3 and 4 are connected reversely, you can see the nozzle temperature displayed on the LCD screen will be much higher than the room temperature after you powered on the machine.
- When pluging the terminal, **be careful not to push the metal terminal from the plastic case**.     
#### :loudspeaker: **Please note**    
- **The cooling fan must be turned on** (when the temperature of the hot end is higher than 60°C), otherwise the hot end may be blocked or even damaged.  
 - By default, the **working voltage** of the fan and heater at the hot end is **DC 24V**. 
#### Please following the define of terminals to connect the hotend to your control board.  
- **Without extend cable**

- **With extend cable**     
![](./wiring2.jpg)  
#### 6.3 Set hot end type on LCD MENU: Control>>Configure>>Hotend Type: Mixing
:warning: If your printer hasn't a 4.3" TFT-LCD screen, ignore this step.   
:warning: If you can't see the menu on the LCD screen of your printer, please upgrade to the newest version. [:link: **Firmware Download Link**](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Firmware)

### 7. How to load and unload filaments
### :warning: ATTENTION PLEASE
For M4V6 hotend, you need to load 4 filament to the hotend even you print one color 3d model, DONOT leave any channel empty before printing.
- **Load filament to the hotend:**     
[:clapper:video tutorial](https://youtu.be/-47yB95uIxI).
  - Cut the front of the filament with diagonal pliers before loading it to the extruder and hot end.
  - Load 4 filaments to all extruders one by one.
  - Rotate the gear of extruders to load filament one by one, do not rotate each extruder more than 2 turns at a time, until all the filaments enter to the inner PTFE tube of hot end, extrdue more 4 ~ 5 turn for each extruder and then stop.      
  :warning:It is recommened to use the ***Prepare>>Filament>>Extruer: All*** and ***Prepare>>Filament>>Load quickly*** menu to load filamets if your printer has a "filament" Menu.     
  :warning: Don't extrude filament when any one of the channel is empty.     
- **Unload filament from the hotend:**
  - Heating the nozzle (200℃ for PLA / 230℃ for PETG/ABS).
  - Operature on the LCD menu or rotate the extruder gear to unload filaments.

### 8. Steps to use M4V6 hotend
#### Print one color 3D model by M4V6 ho tend
- **Prepare gcode file**. Slicing the 3d modle by using one color 3d printer settings, please refer to [**here**](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Slicing-Guide/tree/master/PrusaSlicer#4-slicing-one-color).   
**Here is a test gcode file for your reference: [:arrow_down: download xyz_cube zip file](./xyz_cube.zip)** and unzip it on PC, and then copy the **xyz_cube.gcode** to SD card. Plug the SD card to the SD socket of machine.
- **Load filaments**. Refer to [:point_up: **"How to load and unload filament"**](#load-and-unload-filament) to load all 4 color filaments to the extruders and hotend.     
- **Print from SD card**. Move item to **Print** item on LCD screen and click the knob and choose the gcode file, click knob to start print.
- **Fine tune nozzle height**. Wait the nozzle and hotbed heating, and when the printer starting to print the first layer, double click the knob of LCD screen to fine tune the distance from the nozzle to the bed, and then wait it to finish.
#### Print multi color 3D model
- **Prepare gcode file**. Slicing the 3d modle by using M4 multi color 3d printer settings, please refer to [**here**](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Slicing-Guide/blob/master/PrusaSlicer/PrusaSlicerGuide_M4.md).   
**Here is a test gcode file for your reference: [:arrow_down: **download M4_4CTest zip file](./M4_4CTest.zip)** and unzip it on PC, and then copy the **M4_4CTest.gcode** to SD card. Plug the SD card to the SD socket of machine.
- **Load filaments**. Refer to [:point_up: **"How to load and unload filament"**](#load-and-unload-filament) to load all 4 color filaments to the extruders and hotend.
- **Print from SD card**. Move item to **Print** item on LCD screen and click the knob and choose the gcode file, click knob to start print.
- **Fine tune nozzle height**. Wait the nozzle and hotbed heating, and when the printer starting to print the first layer, double click the knob of LCD screen to fine tune the distance from the nozzle to the bed, and then wait it to finish.

[:book: Use M4V6 to achieve high-speed printing](./HighFlow/readme.md)

### :page_with_curl: Appendix II: How to clean the blocked M4V6 hotend
If [**all four filaments are loaded correctly**](#how-to-load-and-unload-filament), usually the M4V6 hot end is not easy to be clogged.    
#### 1. Take down the nozzle from the hotend.
#### 2. load all 4 filaments to the hot end, and ensure that the filaments enter the bottom of the hot end.
#### 3. Heating the nozzle to over 200 degree and feed some filament from 
Rotate the gear of the extruders to feed filaments, but you should rotate the gears of four extruders simultaneously (that is, do not rotate the gears of the same extruder more than one turn each time). 
If you find that the filament is slipping on the gear of the extruder, you can:
    - Increase the pressure of the extruder or 
    - Take down the PTFE tube from the fittings of the hotend and push the filaments into the hotend by hand directly.
#### 4. Install the nozzle back to the hot end
#### 5. Extrude filaments one by one
##### If the hot end cannot be cleaned by doing the above steps, or the hot end is still easily clogged after cleaning, you need to replace the nozzle or replace the "inner PTFE tubes"
**[:book:How to replace the inner PTFE tubes](#how-to-replace-of-the-inner-ptfe-guide).**
##### Why the hot end is blocked
- If the filaments are not loaded properly before printing, for example, one of the channels is empty or the filament is not loaded deep enough reached to the ***heating block***, the molten filaments will flow back into the empty channels and cause blockage.       
:pill:In this case, you can heat the hot end and then insert the filament into the PTFE tube and push it manually (it is better to remove the nozzle first before inserting the filament).       
- If the ***inner PTFE tubes*** are not inserted enough deep to reach the bottom of the hot end, the molten filaments will flow back into the ***isolation block***  and cause blockage.        
:pill:In this case, you can heat the hot end and then insert the PTFE tube downward into the hot end. If the PTFE tube cannot be inserted, please refer to [**"How to replace of the inner PTFE guide"**](#how-to-replace-of-the-inner-ptfe-guide) to disamble the heating block and clean the ***isolation block***.

### :page_with_curl: Appendix III: How to replace of the inner PTFE tubes
- Prepare 4 piece PTFE tube (ID=2mm/OD=4mm), length is about 100mm (Fig 1). To cut the PTFE pipe by a knife (paper cutter) and try to keep the front end flat.
- Remove the screws which to fix the hot end on the top of the hot end housing (Fig 2).
- Loosen the screws which to fix the heater and temperature sensor (Fig 3).
- Remove the heater and temperature sensor from the hot end (Fig 4).
- Remove the hot end from the housing (Fig 5).
- Remove the 2 screws to fix the heating block (Fig 6).
- Pull out the heating block (Fig 7).
- Press the “RED ring” of the fitting and pull out the PTFE tube (Fig 8).
- Insert the new PTFE tube and install the heating block back in reverse order.
- Push the PTFE guide to the bottom after installed the heating block.
