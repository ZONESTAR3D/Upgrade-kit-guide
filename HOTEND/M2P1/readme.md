## Working principle of M2P1 hotend
3-IN-2-OUT (M2P1) hot end has 3 input channels and 2 nozzles. The filaments of two input channels will melt and mix together in the hot end, and then extrude out through another nozzle. There is also an independent channel, which is suitable for printing different types of materials, such as support materials (PVA or HIPS).
