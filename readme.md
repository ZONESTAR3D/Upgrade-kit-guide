### Bed Leveling Sensor 
Hot bed tilt / uneven surface is a common problem of 3D printer, however, the first layer is very important for the successfully print. The main solution to slove this problem is to use a ***bed leveling sensor*** to measure the distance between the nozzle with the hot bed, to generate a ***"hot bed height table"***, and save it in the memory of the 3D printer. While printing, automatically adjust the height of the nozzle to compensate the uneven hot bed. For more information on this issue, please refer to [**Marlin documents - Automatic Bed Leveling**](https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/auto_bed_leveling.html)    
**There are several types of bed leveling sensor:**      
- **PL-08N** is a proximity sensor, it can probing metal hotbed. If your hot bed surface is metal, such as aluminum plate + hot bed adhesive tape, aluminum plate + magnetic hot bed paste, elastic rigid hot bed, etc., you can use this sensor.

- **BLtouch(3DTouch)** is a "famous" bed auto leveling sensor for 3D Printers, it integrates a simple servo motor and an electromagnetic sensor into a very small volume. It can be used for all types of heat beds with high accuracy. The disadvantage is that the wiring and use are a little complex.

- **ZL-Sensor** is a special photoelectric sensor made by ZONESTAR, it can probing almost all meterial hotbed, also it is easier to wiring such as PL-08N. [**View details**](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002865311470.html)  

### Direct Drive Extruder 
By using the direct drive extruder, the printer can print flexible filament (e.g. TPU filament) and get better printing quality.

### Filament RunOut Sensor (FROD)
Fialment run out sensor use a switch to check for the presence of filament in the feeder. If the filament spool runs out, the 3d printer will pause print and wait  you to replace a new spool.
