3. Turn the cloth cover over so that the reflective surface of the aluminum foil faces outward. Insert two 4mm diameter fiber rods into the cloth grooves on both sides of the top of the cloth sleeve until they protrude from the small holes on the top. Then, insert the ends of the two protruding fiber rods into the metal connectors to connect them. Do it at the other side by the same steps.

4. Turn the cloth cover over with the black side facing outward. Flatten the top so that the two fiber rods extend the same length as before. Then insert the top of the fiber rod into the 3-angle connector fixed to the top frame of the machine.
